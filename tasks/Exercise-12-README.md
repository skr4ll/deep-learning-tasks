# Exercise 12

This is the twelfth exercise for the course [Deep Learning](https://lehre.idh.uni-koeln.de/lehrveranstaltungen/wintersemester-2024-2025/deep-learning/).

Clone this repository to your local setup. Create a branch with the name of your GitHub account and switch to it.

For this exercise, re-visit the token classification task from exercise 10. In the repository, you find the same CSV file with a token per line and named entity (NE) labels for each token.

Use one of the available BERT models from HuggingFace to do NER on the data, on the same train-test splits that you've used for exercise 10. Compare your results from exercise 10 and using BERT.

Run a second experiment, where you fine-tune your chosen BERT model on the train-split. You can follow the guide on https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/en/chapter7/2

Commit your changes and push them to the branch with the name of your GitHub account.

Deadline for this exercise is January 23, 2025, 08:00:00 CET.
