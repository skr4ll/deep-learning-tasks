# Exercise 10

This is the tenth exercise for the course [Deep Learning](https://lehre.idh.uni-koeln.de/lehrveranstaltungen/wintersemester-2024-2025/deep-learning/).

Clone this repository to your local setup. Create a branch with the name of your GitHub account and switch to it.

In the repository, you find a CSV file with a token per line and part-of-speech (POS) and named entity (NE) labels for each token.

Train a LSTM and a BiLSTM with Keras to predict the POS and NE labels. Train on 90% of the dataset and test on the remaining 10%.
Use and implement several of the training strategies presented in the [lecture](https://lehre.idh.uni-koeln.de/site/assets/files/5372/presentation08.pdf).

Let the model predict on the test set and compute Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-score.
Try to get an F1 score as high as possible.

Also compare your results with using a RNN.

Commit your changes and push them to the branch with the name of your GitHub account.

Deadline for this exercise is December 19, 2024, 08:00:00 CET.
