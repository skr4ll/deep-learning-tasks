# Exercise 5

This is the fifth exercise for the course [Deep Learning](https://lehre.idh.uni-koeln.de/lehrveranstaltungen/wintersemester-2024-2025/deep-learning/).

Clone this repository to your local setup. Create a branch with the name of your GitHub account and switch to it.

In the repository, you find a CSV file with data about the passengers of the titanic, including names, gender, age, passenger class and whether they survived. 

Build a feed-forward neural network with Keras (you can choose the number of layers, neurons and activation functions) to predict if a passenger survived given the features "Age" and "Pclass".
You can use the `fit()` method in Keras (https://keras.io/api/models/model_training_apis) to achieve training.
Look at the weights of each layer before and after training and how they changed.
Also look at the loss during training and check if the model converges and if yes, after how many epochs.

Commit your changes and push them to the branch with the name of your GitHub account.

Deadline for this exercise is November 14, 2024, 08:00:00 CET.
