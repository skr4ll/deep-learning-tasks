# Exercise 11

This is the eleventh exercise for the course [Deep Learning](https://lehre.idh.uni-koeln.de/lehrveranstaltungen/wintersemester-2024-2025/deep-learning/).

Clone this repository to your local setup. Create a branch with the name of your GitHub account and switch to it.

In the repository, you find a CSV file with one sentence per line.

Train a LSTM to be a language model on a training split of this dataset.
Let the model predict next words on sequences of the test set and compare with the original sentences.

Commit your changes and push them to the branch with the name of your GitHub account.

Deadline for this exercise is January 09, 2025, 08:00:00 CET.
